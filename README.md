# CodeChefSubmitHelper

Ever tried your hands on past contest problems on CodeChef?

You have to remove the contest name in the address bar and reload the page (which opens the problem in practice mode) before submitting.

This extension adds a submit button to past contest problems so you can directly submit from the contest page itself.

Also, a past contest's page shows number of successful submissions and accuracy for all problems. For a user who attempts the problem-set later, the stats shown can unintentionally influence him/her to solve a particular problem before others.
This extension sets these stats to zero so that the user can get a feel of a live contest.
